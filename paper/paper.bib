	Abstract = {The short exciton diffusion length associated with most classical organic semiconductors used in organic photovoltaics (5-20 nm) imposes severe limits on the maximum size of the donor and acceptor domains within the photoactive layer of the cell. Identifying materials that are able to transport excitons over longer distances can help advancing our understanding and lead to solar cells with higher efficiency. Here, we measure the exciton diffusion length in a wide range of nonfullerene acceptor molecules using two different experimental techniques based on photocurrent and ultrafast spectroscopy measurements. The acceptors exhibit balanced ambipolar charge transport and surprisingly long exciton diffusion lengths in the range of 20 to 47 nm. With the aid of quantum-chemical calculations, we are able to rationalize the exciton dynamics and draw basic chemical design rules, particularly on the importance of the end-group substituent on the crystal packing of nonfullerene acceptors.},

abstract  ="Solution processed organic solar cells (OSCs) composed of all small molecules (ASM) are promising for production on an industrial scale owing to the properties of small molecules{,} such as well-defined chemical structures{,} high purity of materials{,} and outstanding repeatability from batch to batch synthesis. Remarkably{,} ASM OSCs with power conversion efficiency (PCE) beyond 13% were achieved by structure improvement of the electron donor and choosing Y6 as the electron acceptor. However{,} the fill factor (FF) is an obstacle that limits the further improvement of the PCE for these ASM OSCs. Herein{,} we focus on the FF improvement of recently reported ASM OSCs with BTR-Cl:Y6 as the active layer by miscibility-induced active layer morphology optimization. The incorporation of fullerene derivatives{,} which have good miscibility with both BTR-Cl and Y6{,} results in reduced bimolecular recombination and thus improved FF. In particular{,} when ca. 5 wt% of PC71BM was added in the active layer{,} a FF of 77.11% was achieved without sacrificing the open circuit voltage (VOC) and the short circuit current density (JSC){,} leading to a record PCE of 15.34% (certified at 14.7%) for ASM OSCs. We found that the optimized device showed comparable charge extraction{,} longer charge carrier lifetime{,} and slower bimolecular recombination rate compared with those of the control devices (w/o fullerene). Our results demonstrate that the miscibility driven regulation of active layer morphology by incorporation of a fullerene derivative delicately optimizes the active layer microstructures and improves the device performance{,} which brings vibrancy to OSC research."}

title = "Effects of Fluorination on Fused Ring Electron Acceptor for Active Layer Morphology, Exciton Dissociation, and Charge Recombination in Organic Solar Cells",
abstract = "Fluorination is one of the effective approaches to alter the organic semiconductor properties that impact the performance of the organic solar cells (OSCs). Positive effects of fluorination are also revealed in the application of fused ring electron acceptors (FREAs). However, in comparison with the efforts allocated to the material designs and power conversion efficiency enhancement, understanding on the excitons and charge carriers' behaviors in high-performing OSCs containing FREAs is limited. Herein, the impact of fluorine substituents on the active layer morphology, and therefore exciton dissociation, charge separation, and charge carriers' recombination processes are examined by fabricating OSCs with PTO2 as the donor and two FREAs, O-IDTT-IC and its fluorinated analogue O-IDTT-4FIC, as the acceptors. With the presence of O-IDTT-4FIC in the devices, it is found that the excitons dissociate more efficiently, and the activation energy required to split the excitons to free charge carriers is much lower; the charge carriers live longer and suffer less extent of trap-assisted recombination; the trap density is 1 order of magnitude lower than that of the nonfluorinated counterpart. Overall, these findings provide information about the complex impacts of FREA fluorination on efficiently performed OSCs.",

title = "Charge Transport Layers Limiting the Efficiency of Perovskite Solar Cells: How To Optimize Conductivity, Doping, and Thickness",
abstract = "Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are one of the main research topics of the photovoltaic community; with efficiencies now reaching up to 24%, PSCs are on the way to catching up with classical inorganic solar cells. However, PSCs have not yet reached their full potential. In fact, their efficiency is still limited by nonradiative recombination, mainly via trap-states and by losses due to the poor transport properties of the commonly used transport layers (TLs). Indeed, state-of-the-art TLs (especially if organic) suffer from rather low mobilities, typically within 10(-5) and 10(-2) cm(-2) V-1 s(-1), when compared to the high mobilities, 1-10 cm(-2) V-1 s(-1), measured for perovskites. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of the effect of the mobility, thickness, and doping density of the transport layers based on combined experimental and modeling results of two sets of devices made of a solution-processed high-performing triple-cation (PCE approximate to 20%). The results are also cross-checked on vacuum-processed MAPbI(3) devices. From this analysis, general guidelines on how to optimize a TL are introduced and especially a new and simple formula to easily calculate the amount of doping necessary to counterbalance the low mobility of the TLs.",
